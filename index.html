        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Brooke Perez. Currently, I am a student at the University of California, Riverside. As a first year at the university, I have declared my major in Media and Cultural Studies to futher myself in the world of marketing and advertising. I know that with a degree from one of the best universities in the country, I will be able to accomplish my goal of being in social media marketing and advertising one day. Along with being a committed student at this top tier university, I am also a student athlete. With hard work and grit being put into my school and athletic life, I am able to make it further and further everyday.<br><br>

        As a student athlete, I have always been determined to be the best at what I do. Starting in highschool, I made it my goal to be able to handle both a job, school, and athletics. With dedication to this passion, I was able to handle all three in the best way I could've handled it. I was able to keep my grades high and maintain an above average GPA in highschool. I was able to accomplish being one of the top athletes in my conference for softball. I was able to keep a great image on myself as a worker while I worked at Chick-fil-a. Without devotion to all three of these things, I would not be where I am todaay. My hardwork was able to show through when it came to being rewarded. In my up and coming years in college as a student athelete, I aspire to continue this reputation. I strive to show up as a great student and a great player all in one.<br><br>

        In my future, I can see myself as a professional buisness woman. I will work towards my future to make it bright and enjoyable. I know that with hardwork, I will be able to one day look at myself in the mirror and be happy. With my goal of working in social media marketing and advertising, I will go to great lengths to achieve this goal. My hard work in sports and school will allow me to one day achieve all of my dreams. Aside from my goals and dreams for my future, I am also a normal person. Outside of sports and scool, I enjoy the art of photo taking. With a camera on me everywhere I go, I love taking photos of people and places. For my friends and family, I am always enjoying the simple moments and must capture them on camera. Photos are important to me because they pause that special moment in time. It allows me to one day come back to that place in memory and in feeling. Not only do I love to take photos, I am a big family person. Time with my family is the most special time that I could ask for in life. Sisters, cousins, dogs, all of my family is included when I say "family." I make sure to take these family morals and standards and implement them into my daily life. It is important to me and who I am as a person. It is what defines me and makes me a better person everyday.
